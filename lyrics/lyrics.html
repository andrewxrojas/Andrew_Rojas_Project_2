        Hmm... hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
        Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
        Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
        Sometimes in our lives
        We all have pain
        We all have sorrow
        But if we are wise
        We know that there's always tomorrow
        Lean on me
        When you're not strong
        And I'll be your friend
        I'll help you carry on...
        For it won't be long
        Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
        Please swallow your pride
        If I have things you need to borrow
        For no one can fill
        Those of your needs that you won't let show
        You just call on me brother when you need a hand
        We all need somebody to lean on
        I just might have a problem that you'll understand
        We all need somebody to lean on
        <br>
        <br>
        Lean on me
        When you're not strong
        And I'll be your friend
        I'll help you carry on...
        For it won't be long
        Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
        You just call on me brother
        When you need a hand
        We all need somebody to lean on
        I just might have a problem that you'll understand
        We all need somebody to lean on
        If there is a load you have to bear
        That you can't carry
        I'm right up the road
        I'll share your load
        If you just call me
        <br>
        <br>
        Call me
        If you need a friend
        (Call me)
        Call me (call me)
        If you need a friend
        (Call me)
        If you ever need a friend
        (Call me)
        Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me)
        If you need a friend
        (Call me)
        Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me) Call me
        (Call me)
