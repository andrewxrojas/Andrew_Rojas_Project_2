# Project 2: What does community mean to you?
By Andrew Rojas 

# Project overview 
In my second project, I embarked on a journey to explore the profound concept of community and what it truly means to me. Beyond just contemplating its definition, I sought to encapsulate the essence of community in the evocative words of a song or poem. The song that resonated most with my understanding of community was Bill Withers' "Lean on Me" â€“ a timeless classic that beautifully encapsulates the spirit of togetherness and support.

My project is a simple yet poignant expression of this idea, distilled into a few lines of lyrics on a single page. Each line conveys a unique facet of the meaning of community.

Page 1: "We all have pain... We all have sorrow" - This line underscores the universality of human experience. Despite our diverse backgrounds and life paths, we all share the fundamental human emotions of pain and sorrow.

Page 2: "But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow" - This page imparts a sense of hope, reminding us that, no matter how challenging our current circumstances may be, there's always a new day on the horizon. Our struggles are temporary, and better days await.

Page 3: "Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long, 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." - This page is the climax and conclusion, encapsulating the essence of community support. It echoes the idea that in times of weakness or adversity, we can rely on the strength and friendship of others. Moreover, it emphasizes the interconnectedness of our lives; just as we seek support, we, too, have a role to play in being there for others.

Page 4: Paying Tribute and Sharing the Lyrics - The fourth page pays homage to the artist, Bill Withers, and provides the complete lyrics of the song, allowing for a deeper appreciation of its message and artistry.

In essence, my project conveys the profound understanding that community means we are never alone in our journey through life. Regardless of the challenges we face, there is always someone willing to lend a helping hand, a listening ear, or a shoulder to lean on. It's a beautiful cycle of support where, without even realizing it, we become both the recipients and providers of hope and companionship in the intricate web of our shared human experiences.
