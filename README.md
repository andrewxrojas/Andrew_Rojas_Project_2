# Project 2: What does community mean to you?
By Andrew Rojas 

# Project overview 
 I embarked on this journey where I wanted to explore the profound concept of community and what it truly means to me. Beyond just contemplating its definition, I sought to encapsulate the essence of community in the evocative words of a song or poem. The song that resonated most with my understanding of community was Bill Withers' "Lean on Me" â€“ a timeless classic that beautifully encapsulates the spirit of togetherness and support.

In order to achieve this I created a website that is simple yet poignant expression of this idea, distilled into a few lines of lyrics on a single page. Each line conveys a unique facet of the meaning of community.

Page 1 and Page 2: "We all have pain... We all have sorrow" - This line underscores the universality of human experience. Despite our diverse backgrounds and life paths, we all share the fundamental human emotions of pain and sorrow.

Page 3: "But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow" - This page imparts a sense of hope, reminding us that, no matter how challenging our current circumstances may be, there's always a new day on the horizon. Our struggles are temporary, and better days await.

Page 4 and Page 5: "Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long, 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." - This page is the climax and conclusion, encapsulating the essence of community support. It echoes the idea that in times of weakness or adversity, we can rely on the strength and friendship of others. Moreover, it emphasizes the interconnectedness of our lives; just as we seek support, we, too, have a role to play in being there for others.

Page 6: Paying Tribute and Sharing the Lyrics - The fourth page pays homage to the artist, Bill Withers, and provides the complete lyrics of the song, allowing for a deeper appreciation of its message and artistry.

In essence, my pasion project conveys the profound understanding that community means we are never alone in our journey through life. Regardless of the challenges we face, there is always someone willing to lend a helping hand, a listening ear, or a shoulder to lean on. It's a beautiful cycle of support where, without even realizing it, we become both the recipients and providers of hope and companionship in the intricate web of our shared human experiences.

# Technical overview

The structure and navigation of the website are straightforward, ensuring a seamless user experience.The website's foundation is built upon HTML and CSS, providing a reliable and versatile platform for content presentation and styling.The text content on the website is interactive, enhancing user engagement. Users can hover over text or click on specific elements to navigate seamlessly to the next page.The website features vertical scrolling to display lyrics on a single line by using jumplinks to navigate to a specific part of the page.
<br>
The initial animation on the first page will scale the word "WE," highlighting our sense of community. Simultaneously, the lyrics bearing the word "Pain" will smoothly transition from white to a vivid red hue to symbolize suffering and distress and will guide the user to the next page. 
<br>
When the user arrives on the second page, the subsequent part of the lyrics will once again magnify the word "WE," serving as a poignant reminder of our shared experiences. As the lyrics progress, the term "sorrow" will adopt a blur effect with different hues changing its color to a soft, inviting pink shade, signaling the user to click and proceed to the next page.
<br>
Upon arriving on the third page, the subsequent lyrics container will gracefully fade. Only "if we are wise" will persist, and "wise" will scale and rotate under "if we are" to instruct the user to navigate down to the following line. Continuing to the next line, the word "that" will also undergo scaling to guide the user to navigate to the following link while maintaining a consistent style with the previous line. The phrase "there's always" will remain static. At the same time, "tomorrow will rotate under "there's always" and undergo a scale animation and an engaging right-skewed animation. Furthermore, an opaque hover effect will be applied to "tomorrow," signaling to the user that they should click on this text to proceed to the next page.
<br>
Arriving on the fourth page, the user will see the words "Lean" skewing right, followed by "on me, when you're not," and the word "strong" will travel along the X and Y axis diagonally above the word "when" and significantly scale sizes as it transitions colors from white, soft pink to a deep pink, this word will also navigate the user to the following line. Subsequently, the lyrics, "and I'll be your," will transition between hues of soft pink to deep pink, where "friend" will fade in and scale in size to guide the user to navigate to the following line. The following lyrics, "I'll help you," will carry on," will remain static; however, "carry on" will have a soft glowing pink with an opaque hover effect to guide the user to the next page. 
<br>
On the fifth page, the lyrics will be as follows: "For it won't be long, 'till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." To achieve this, "For it won't be" will remain static with a white hue. The phrase "long" will significantly scale, rotate under "For it won't be," and skew right with gradient hues of powder pink, light pink, and intense pink," to guide the user down the following link, where the user will see " till' I'm gonna" in a transition animation from white, soft pink, to a deep pink, following the words "need" which will use a fade in animation and scaling effect to instruct the user to the last line which is "Somebody to lean on." The phrase "Somebody to" will remain static and white, whereas "lean on" will have a glowing animation consisting of gold, white, and pink hues to instruct the user to navigate to the next page. 
<br>
The sixth page will be an acknowledgment page to Bill Withers, with lyrics to Lean on Me and a home link to navigate back to the first page.
