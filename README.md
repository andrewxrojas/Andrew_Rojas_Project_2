# Project 2: What does community mean to you?
By Andrew Rojas 

# Project overview 
In my second project, I embarked on a journey to explore the profound concept of community and what it truly means to me. Beyond just contemplating its definition, I sought to encapsulate the essence of community in the evocative words of a song or poem. The song that resonated most with my understanding of community was Bill Withers' "Lean on Me" â€“ a timeless classic that beautifully encapsulates the spirit of togetherness and support.

My project is a simple yet poignant expression of this idea, distilled into a few lines of lyrics on a single page. Each line conveys a unique facet of the meaning of community.

Page 1: "We all have pain... We all have sorrow" - This line underscores the universality of human experience. Despite our diverse backgrounds and life paths, we all share the fundamental human emotions of pain and sorrow.

Page 2: "But if we are wise we know that there's always tomorrow" - This page imparts a sense of hope, reminding us that, no matter how challenging our current circumstances may be, there's always a new day on the horizon. Our struggles are temporary, and better days await.

Page 3: "Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long, 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." - This page is the climax and conclusion, encapsulating the essence of community support. It echoes the idea that in times of weakness or adversity, we can rely on the strength and friendship of others. Moreover, it emphasizes the interconnectedness of our lives; just as we seek support, we, too, have a role to play in being there for others.

Page 4: Paying Tribute and Sharing the Lyrics - The fourth page pays homage to the artist, Bill Withers, and provides the complete lyrics of the song, allowing for a deeper appreciation of its message and artistry.

In essence, my project conveys the profound understanding that community means we are never alone in our journey through life. Regardless of the challenges we face, there is always someone willing to lend a helping hand, a listening ear, or a shoulder to lean on. It's a beautiful cycle of support where, without even realizing it, we become both the recipients and providers of hope and companionship in the intricate web of our shared human experiences.

# Technical overview 
This project is a four-page website crafted using HTML and CSS, designed with user-friendliness and interactivity in mind. The structure and navigation of the website are straightforward, ensuring a seamless user experience.The website's foundation is built upon HTML and CSS, providing a reliable and versatile platform for content presentation and styling.The text content on the website is interactive, enhancing user engagement. Users can hover over text or click on specific elements to navigate seamlessly to the next page.The website features horizontal scrolling to display lyrics on a single line, departing from the traditional vertical scroll approach, where lyrics are typically presented in a column format.

The initial animation on the first page will dynamically scale the word "WE," highlighting our sense of community. Simultaneously, the lyrics bearing the word "Pain" will undergo a smooth transition by fading in, painted in a vivid red hue to symbolize suffering and distress. The subsequent part of the lyrics will once again magnify the word "WE," serving as a poignant reminder of our shared experiences. As the lyrics progress, the word "sorrow" will adopt a hover effect, changing its color to a soft, inviting pink shade, signaling to the user to click and proceed to the next page.

Upon clicking the "next page" button, the subsequent lyrics container will gracefully fade out. Only "But if we are" and "wise" will persist, while scaling, and their color will be a calming blue, creating a minimalist, focused display.

In the second line, the word "WE" will also undergo scaling, maintaining a consistent style with the previous line. The phrase "we know that there's always" will gently fade out, while "tomorrow" will maintain an engaging right-skewed animation. Furthermore, a pink hover effect will be applied to "tomorrow," signaling to the user that they should click on this text to proceed to the next page.

On the third page, the lyrics will ultimately present as follows: "Lean on me, for it won't be long, 'till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." To achieve this, "Lean on me" will remain static in a skewed-right position. The phrase "when you're not strong" will gently fade out entirely, utilizing a fade out transition.

Subsequently, the following lyrics, "and I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on," will first scale for emphasis and then fade out completely with a fade out annimation. What will persist on the page is the line "for it won't be long, 'till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on."

The word "Lean on" will feature a pink hover effect, prompting the user to click it to navigate to the next page, where the artist Bill Withers will be credited, and the entire song's lyrics will be displayed. Additionally, the footer of the page will include a "HOME" link to conveniently guide the user back to the website's beginning.
